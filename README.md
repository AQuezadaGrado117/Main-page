* What do you value in a career? what are the most important parts?

  In a career I value the impact and objective the indivual choosing the career holds. I do not believe in fully commiting oneslef to a specific task for the remainder of thier life. In other words a career isnt important but it is important to have your main practice be something that can be very diverse.

* What is the ideal industry you would ike to work in?

I would like to work in the development of technoilgy. As of right now I have my sight set on drone mapping in order to create an advanced form of enviorment analysis paired with augmented reality and virtual reality. To achieve this goal resources, knowldege and support will be crucial so computer science, cyber securty, and business are all mixed in if the correct jobs are chosen.

* What job tittle is the closest to your ideal career?

  So far it seems to be software development manager but that is not exactly close.
  
* How does the job tittle align with what you value in a career?

  It allows me to be working on new and exciting projects while persuing other ends and not spending all my time on a single objective.

* How does that job tittle align wiht what your personal interests are, if any? 

The job is simply a means to an end I do not intent to work for anyone but myself so the only interest it alligns with is the knowldege I wish to aquire and the diversity in projects that i would work on. 

* How does the job posting you found embody that?

  It emodies my idea of growth and develpment within a collaborative enviorment in which I would have to function with multiple different topics and groups. 

* What is the ideal career path to get that job posting, from where you now?

  The ideal path is currently to learn as much as I can about computer science and cyber security while getting an understanding of business and the applications of technoolfy in bussiness.
